"""scsim -- the executable front of the interactive Scattering tool.

This file is deliberately almost empty. The command's body is
`scattering.cli.scsim`, because the tool is reached in two ways that
must run the same code (physdemo contract C5):

- through THIS script, which the `physdemo` suite links into its
  commands and which a clone runs directly, with nothing installed;
- through the `scsim` console script that `pip install` creates,
  which calls `scattering.cli.scsim.console_main`.

Three things here are load-bearing, and the suite depends on them
(contract C2): the `#!/usr/bin/env python3` first line and the
executable bit, so the script runs by name with whatever Python the
active environment provides; and the RESOLVED path below, because
the script is normally run through a symbolic link, and the
unresolved path would name the link rather than this file.

Run `scsim --help` for the usage.
