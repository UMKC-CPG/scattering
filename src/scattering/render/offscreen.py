"""Choosing VTK's window class for offscreen drawing (pseudocode
11.6). This module imports neither vtk nor vedo, because its one
function must run BEFORE either is imported: VTK fixes its window
class at import time from the environment variable
VTK_DEFAULT_OPENGL_WINDOW.

The rule is the physdemo suite's, and it is portable by construction:

- Offscreen requested, on Linux: ask for VTK's EGL window class,
  whatever DISPLAY says. A DISPLAY that is set but dead (a stale SSH
  forwarding) is common on clusters, and VTK's X window class hangs
  on it; so the decision keys on what was asked for, not on DISPLAY.
- On screen: leave VTK alone; its default window class is right.
- macOS and Windows: do nothing. Their default window classes draw
  offscreen unaided, and EGL does not exist there.

An explicit VTK_DEFAULT_OPENGL_WINDOW in the environment always wins.

Attribution: this module is part of the scattering teaching tool.
