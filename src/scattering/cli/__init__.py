"""The bodies of the command-line entry points (ARCHITECTURE 4.13).

A command is reached in two ways that must run the same code: the
executable scripts in `src/scripts/`, which the `physdemo` suite links
and a clone runs directly, and the console scripts that `pip install`
creates from `pyproject.toml`. So each command's body lives here, in
the library, and the two fronts are a few lines each.

Nothing in the package imports `cli/`; it sits at the top of the
dependency graph (ARCHITECTURE 5) and holds no physics.

Attribution: this module is part of the scattering teaching tool.
