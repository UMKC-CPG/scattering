"""What every command of the tool shares: the rc lookup, the command
log, the packaged examples, the rc copy, and the self-check (physdemo
PSEUDOCODE 4.5). INHERITED from the physdemo member-tool skeleton;
a change is made there and carried here.

A student who installed the tool with `pip`, or who is using a shared
installation that someone else made and that they cannot write to,
has no idea where the example run files or the rc file are, and
should not need to. Everything in this module therefore finds its
files THROUGH THE PACKAGE, never relative to a script or to the
working directory. That one rule is what makes a clone, a linked
`physdemo` suite, and an installed copy behave identically.

Nothing here touches the physics. These are ways of getting to a run.

Attribution: this module is inherited from the physdemo suite's
member-tool skeleton (github.com/UMKC-CPG/physdemo), which
reconciled the `rigid_body` and `scattering` tools' copies of it; it
is part of the Scattering teaching tool.
